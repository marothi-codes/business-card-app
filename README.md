# Business Card Application

## What's the big idea?

The aim is to demonstrate the usage of Prisma ORM, NextAuth, Next.js and your Database type of choice be it a relational database or noSQL database.
The techniques used in this basic application showcase how simple it is to implement authentication with any provider of your choice, using an ORM to connect to any kind of major database system while being able to get more done quickly in order to deliver a high quality application in record time.

## What technologies did I use?

- [Prisma ORM](https://prisma.io) The ORM for communicating with the database (PostgreSQL in my case).
- [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org) The best authentication mechanism for Next.js projects (Supports most if not all OAuth authentication providers).
- [NextAuth.js](https://nextjs.org) The React framework that has everything you could ask for.

## What do I think?

Next.js, NextAuth, Prisma, a state management workflow be it flux, redux, a CMS like contentful or sanity (if needed) and other libraries to make your application happen (especially in this age of JAMstack websites) is definitely the way to go. You will definitely have a high quality production application real fast without compromising on quality and the developer experience of course.
